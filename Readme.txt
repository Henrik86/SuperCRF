SuperCRF: 
============
Matlab scripts for the training of a SuperCRF, that combines Superpixel annotations in different scales as well as single class classifications.


The CRF is based in the UGM toolbox (https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~schmidtm/Software/UGM.html)


Dataset:
============
Sample barcodes from TCGA that were used for training and testing of the SuperCRF.
The images can easily be accessed using the GDC client and TCGA (https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/).
